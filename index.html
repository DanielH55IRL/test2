           <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            COVID-19 is a <b>new</b> illness that can affect your lungs and airways.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The illness is caused by the <b>SARS-nCOV-2</b> virus a new novel Coronavirus, this is similar to the the SARS virus outbreak seen in 2003 in Asia.
            <br>
            <br>
            COVID-19 is highly contagious and currently has no treatment or cure.
            <br>
            Goverments and Pharmaceutical companies are currently trying to find and produce viable treatment options.
            <br>
            <br>
            Currently the World Health Organization (WHO) reccomends testing, isolation and contact tracing as the main steps in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
            <br>
            <br>
            These measures combined with "social distancing" are designed to help reduce the spread of the virus and reduce the stress on the global health care system.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many countries globally have gone into temporary "lockdowns", in which citizens are unable to go to work, school, shopping, etc.
            Only going food shopping or working in essential industies are people allowed to leave their homes while adhering to social distancing guidlines.
